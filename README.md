### My actual projects
*RPGmanager*
When I was younger I spent a lot of time in front of the RTS games and I absolutelly felt in love with StarCraft. From the other side I really like board games and pen&paper RPGs. Few months ago I found interesting project of StarCraft pen&paper RPG and I decided to build session manager. Actually I call this project RPGmanager and it will be website supporting game sessions in StarCraft RPG. I would like to create a set of tools to support players and game master and to make the experience of playing more exciting without spending money for expensive assets and gadgets.

The project has low priority, but when it achieve playable stage I will deploy it at github.
